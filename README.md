```javascript
    //Find Best Match Friend Code Below
    var bestMatch = {};
    var matchedFriend = 0;
    //Maximum scores for ten questions is 40 (40 = 10 questions x 4 <different between 5 and 1 choices>). 
    //This number is change based on number of questions and choices of answers
    var bestMatchedScore = 40;

    //Loop through all friends array
    for (var friend = 0; friend < friendsData.length; friend++) {
      var totalScoresDiff = 0;
      //Loop through individual's friend scores
      for (var score = 0; score < friendsData[friend].scores.length; score++) {
        var diff = Math.abs(friendsData[friend].scores[score] - newFriend.scores[score]);
        totalScoresDiff += diff;
      }//End of inner loop
      //Console log to check if app gives accurate result.
      console.log(totalScoresDiff, friendsData[friend].name);
      
      if (totalScoresDiff < bestMatchedScore) {
        matchedFriend = friend;
        bestMatchedScore = totalScoresDiff;
      }
    }//End of outter loop
```
